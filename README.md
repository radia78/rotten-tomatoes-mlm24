# Infected Tomato Leaf Vein Segmentation
The project is an extension of the [Plant Pathology Image Processor](https://dsi.wisc.edu/research-portfolio/plant-pathology-image-processor/) project from the Data Science Institute at UW-Madison. The goal of the project is to create a vein-segmentation model that is trained from a handful of hand-annotated training set. Our model managed to achieve a test Jaccard index of 42.6% (the highest in the Kaggle competition).
